# Rating lemon-flavored drinks

You're probably wondering: why? Why rate lemon-flavored drinks?

I'm a huge fan of lemonades, but somehow the overwhelming number of different options made me wonder what the **best** lemonande is.
While evaluating this, I expanded my search space to lemon-flavored drinks, because some aren't sparkling and wouldn't really fall under the "lemonade" term.

## Evaluated Parameters

Every drink is rated based on six parameters:

- 0-10 Sweetness
- 0-10 Sourness
- 0-10 Bitterness
- 0-10 Sparkliness
- 0-10 Taste (just my opinion, really)
- Price per 100ml in €

A combination of taste and price per 100 ml is then used to discern a final rating from 0-10.

This ensures that even if a drink is a 10 and would be considered best in taste, a high price would keep it from dominating the top of the list.
I'm searching for a drink that I can buy regularly without any remorse and also have it taste great.
