# Rating lemon-flavored drinks

You're probably wondering: why? Why rate lemon-flavoured drinks?

I'm a huge fan of lemonades, but somehow the overwhelming number of different options made me wonder what the **best** lemonade is.
While evaluating this, I expanded my search space to lemon-flavoured drinks because some aren't sparkling and wouldn't really fall under the "lemonade" term.

This is still ongoing, as I somehow keep finding new lemon-flavoured drinks to try.

## Methodology

### Evaluated parameters

Every drink is rated based on six parameters:

- 0-10 Sweetness
- 0-10 Sourness
- 0-10 Bitterness
- 0-10 Sparkliness
- 0-10 Taste (just my opinion, really)
- Price per 100ml in €

A combination of taste and price per 100 ml is then used to discern a final rating from 0-10.

This ensures that even if a drink is a 10 and would be considered best in taste, a high price would keep it from dominating the top of the list.
I'm searching for a drink that I can buy regularly without any remorse and also have it taste great.

### Scientific rigor

Because this is a tiny "study" (if you want to call it that) with a sample size of N = 1, it does not hold any scientific meaning.
It would be fun to expand this at some point to maybe three other people or so, just to have better data on the actual perceived sweetness etc.
However, after calculating the time needed to properly conduct this, including blind tasting and enough time between tests for taste buds to not be overwhelmed, I came to the conclusion it's not worth it currently.

A fun idea could be to crowdsource the data from people on the internet (maybe you?).
Maybe I'll set up some website for that in the future.
For now, this is only me and my subjective opinion! 

## Searching for Correlation

After collecting data about 62 drinks, I looked at some possible correlations between different numbers.
The only correlations I found were the following:

### Taste vs Bitterness
